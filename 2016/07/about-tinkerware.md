What about Tinkerware?
===

At tinkerware we look to write posts eventually to keep an update about
the company and how it is growing. So what about it?

Anyone who writes code, does it for a reason: to use the code.
If it is shared or used privately, you surely want it to be available at 
any time.

Nevertheless, to accomplish this, at least the following tasks are needed:

  - Choose between server providers
  - Configure your server
  - Secure your server
  - Deploy your code
  - Keep an eye on your server
  - Hope that nothing will break.

...a lot of times it's hard to find the time to do all this.

This "small" step is the difference between (hopefully) **creating a great
service used by a lot of people** and  - forgetting about that cool small project
you once did in the past...

Other times, paying third parties to perform all these tasks is not an option
since it gets expensive, so why not making these configurations easy for you
and let you handle your own server with freedom with the posibility of growth?

**You can achieve this** with **environments**.
That project you created in your computer is your developent stage and we can
sync it to your production server replicating the environment. That way, any time
you want to add more functionality, it won't be a problem. The deploy will
be transparent and easy by then and you will have your own server at your
disposal at any time if you need it.

But how does it work?

You'd basically do the following:

  - Log in with your account.
  - Select what you want to be installed in your server.
  - Upload to the server the code you want to deploy there.
  - Add your ssh-keys to access.
  - Enjoy! Your code should be working now.

After that you'll get:

  - A development environment to work with. (Using [Vagrant](www.vagrant.com))
    ( Your vagrant will be just as your production server to avoid compatibility issues)
  - Access to your server.
  - Access to a dashboard to make all the steps easily.
  - A full list of your projects to manage.
  - Access to modules to complement your server.

Some of the modules to complement your server would include:

  - Basic security
  - Advanced security
  - Load balancers
  - Monitoring
  - Concurrency/Requests control.

We're cururrently developing the base of all this functionality but we're
glad to say that it is coming soon.
All of this gets automated for your easier management (and ours too), that's
why we will be adding more modules, features and cool stuff depending on how
the users guide us.

We're releasing Beta soon for you to manage your servers without headaches.
