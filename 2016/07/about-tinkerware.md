What about Tinkerware?
===

Anyone who writes code, does it for a reason: to use the code.

At least the following tasks are needed:

  - Choose between server providers
  - Configure your server
  - Secure your server
  - Deploy your code
  - Keep an eye on your server
  - Hope that nothing will break.

...a lot of times it's hard to find the time to do all this.

These steps are the difference between **creating a great
service used by a lot of people** and having a time bomb ticking . . . . .

Other times, having an expert to perform all these tasks is not an option
since it gets expensive, so why not making these configurations easy for you
and let you handle your own server with freedom with the posibility of growth?

**You can achieve this** with **environments** and going more **Serverless**.

That project you created in your computer is your developent stage and it can
be replicated with improvements to be the production server. That way, any time
you want to add more functionality, it won't be a problem.

**The deploy won't even be a deploy**. It'd be a transparent and easy replication
by then and you will have your own server at your disposal at any time if you need it.

But how does it work?

You'd basically do 4 things:

  1. Log in with your account.
  2. Select what you want to be installed in your server/project.
  3. Select existing code if any.
  4. Enjoy! Your code should be working now.

After that you'll get:

  - A development environment to work with. (Using [Vagrant](www.vagrant.com)) Based on your selection.
  - Access to your server.
  - Access to a dashboard to make all the steps easily and mange your projects.
  - Access to modules to improve your server/project.

Some of the modules to complement your server would include:

  - Basic security
  - Load balancers
  - Monitoring
  - Concurrency/Requests control.
  - Frameworks
  - CI/CD Packages
  - Databases
  - Programming Languages
  - Proxy Servers
  - SCMs
  - Extra stuff.

We're cururrently developing the base of all this functionality which is ready for
**Beta testers**. Got to tinkerware.io and request and invite!

All of this gets automated for your easier management (and ours too), that's
why we will be adding more modules, features and cool stuff depending on how
the users guide us.

Worry about servers no more.
